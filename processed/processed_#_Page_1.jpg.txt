Based on the blood test results provided:

1. Hematology:
- Hemoglobin (Hb): 128 g/L (normal range: 130-170): Slightly below the normal range, indicating mild anemia.
- White Blood Cells (WBC): 8.8 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.0-10.0): Within the normal range.
- Neutrophils: 6.0 x 10^9/L (normal range: 2.0-7.0): Within the normal range.
- Lymphocytes: 1.6 x 10^9/L (normal range: 1.0-3.0): Within the normal range.
- Platelets: 222 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-410): Within the normal range.

2. Chemistry:
- Sodium: 142 mmol/L (normal range: 133-146): Within the normal range.
- Potassium: 4.8 mmol/L (normal range: 3.5-5.3): Within the normal range.
- Creatinine: 79 umol/L (normal range: 62-106): Within the normal range.
- Uric Acid: 523 umol/L (normal range: 200-430): Elevated levels, indicating potential kidney issues.
- Glucose: 5.5 mmol/L (normal range: 4.1-6.0): Within the normal range.
- Liver function tests: Generally within normal limits, including Bilirubin, ALP, AST, ALT, and GGT.

3. Other findings:
- CRP: 0.9 mg/L (normal range: <5.0): Within the normal range, indicating no active inflammation.
- LDH: 454 U/L (normal range: <251): Elevated, suggesting tissue damage or other pathology.
- Total Protein and Albumin levels are within normal ranges.
- Calcium, Magnesium, and Phosphate levels are within normal limits.
- Cholesterol level is below the normal range, but may not be clinically significant.
- Anemia with normal MCV, MCH, and MCHC suggests a normocytic normochromic anemia pattern.
- The patient tested negative for COVID-19.

Overall, the blood test results show some abnormalities, notably elevated Uric Acid levels and LDH, which may require further investigation or monitoring. The patient appears to have mild anemia, but overall, the results do not reveal any significant acute issues related to the liver or other major organ systems. It is essential to interpret these results in the context of the patient's clinical history and ongoing medical management. A consultation with a healthcare provider would be necessary to determine the appropriate next steps based on these findings.
